Example: "Perfect order! Herbs are smallest, then shrubs, then trees are tallest."

**Feedback template (Incorrect):**
"Not quite the right order. [Give a hint about one item that is out of place.]"

**Feedback template (Incorrect):**
"Let us think again. [Restate the key fact that disproves the wrong answer.]"
Example: "Let us think again. Tulsi does not have one thick trunk. It has many stems. So it is a shrub."

| 5 | Application, Cause-Effect, Error ID, Open-Ended | Yes/No with Reasoning, Sequencing, Understanding | Recall-only questions (max 1) |

### Question Format per Quiz

Every quiz of 10 questions should include this format mix:
- 3–4 MCQ or True/False
- 2–3 Fill-in-the-blank
- 2 Click/Connect/Match
- 1 Activity-style item (odd-one-out, sorting, or sequencing — NOT wordsearch)

**Note on Wordsearch:** Do not generate ASCII wordsearch grids. LLMs cannot reliably produce valid wordsearch puzzles. Replace with "Odd One Out," "Sort the List," or "Spot the Mistake" activity items. If wordsearch is required, generate only the word list and delegate grid creation to a programmatic tool.
