# Digital Interactions — Allowed Types & Activity Reference

**Purpose:** Defines the canonical interaction enum, grade-specific constraints, and Bloom's-level mapping.
**Authority:** This file is the final authority on which interaction types are allowed per grade. Do NOT invent interaction types or use types not listed for the target grade.

## Bloom's Level × Interaction Type Mapping

Use this table to select interactions that match the cognitive level required by the lesson section.

| Bloom's Level | Best Interaction Types | Why |
|---------------|----------------------|-----|
| L1 Remember | Tap to Select, Tap Yes / No, Reveal on Tap, Tap to Count | Simple recall — child identifies or recognises |
| L2 Understand | Match one item to another, Choose the Odd One Out, Flip to find a pair, Listen and Respond | Child shows understanding by matching or distinguishing |
| L3 Apply | Drag to Sort, Drag and Drop, Drag to Complete, Match item to placeholder, Tap All That Apply | Child applies learned rules to classify or organise |
| L4 Analyze | Drag to reorder items, Tap in Sequence, Choose the Odd One Out (with reasoning) | Child compares, orders, or identifies relationships |
| L5 Evaluate | Tap Yes / No (with reasoning prompt), Tap All That Apply (justify selections) | Child judges correctness and explains why |

**Rule:** When selecting an activity for a lesson, check both (a) the grade allows the interaction type AND (b) the Bloom's level matches the lesson section's target level.

## Grade K (Kindergarten) — All 24 Types Allowed

All interaction types are available for Grade K. This is the widest set because kindergarten lessons use the most varied tactile and audio interactions.

### Allowed Types
**Tap-Based:** Tap to Select, Tap All That Apply, Tap to Count, Tap in Sequence, Tap Yes / No, Reveal on Tap, Tap to Build
**Drag-Based:** Drag and Drop, Drag to Sort, Drag to Complete, Follow the Path, Drag to reorder items, Drag along a path
**Matching & Memory:** Match one item to another, Flip to find a pair, Choose the Odd One Out, Match item to placeholder
**Tracing & Movement:** Trace with Finger, Swipe to Move, Slide to adjust size or value, Scratch to reveal
**Audio-Led:** Listen and Respond, Listen and respond, Listen and act

### Preferred for Grade K
- Tap to Select (simplest interaction)
- Drag and Drop (concrete, tactile)
- Trace with Finger (letter/number formation)
- Listen and act (audio-first for pre-readers)

---

## Grade 1 — 21 Types Allowed

### Allowed Types
**Tap-Based:** Tap to Select, Tap All That Apply, Tap to Count, Tap in Sequence, Tap Yes / No, Reveal on Tap, Tap to Build
**Drag-Based:** Drag and Drop, Drag to Sort, Drag to Complete, Follow the Path, Drag to reorder items

**Tracing & Movement:** Trace with Finger, Swipe to Move, Slide to adjust size or value
**Audio-Led:** Listen and Respond, Listen and respond

### Removed from Grade K
- Drag along a path (replaced by more structured drag interactions)
- Scratch to reveal (novelty interaction, less pedagogical value beyond K)
- Listen and act (voice recording less reliable at this age for assessment)

### Preferred for Grade 1
- Drag to Sort (classification tasks)
- Match one item to another (pairing concepts)
- Tap in Sequence (ordering and patterns)
- Tap to Count (number work)

---

## Grade 2 — 18 Types Allowed

### Allowed Types
**Tap-Based:** Tap to Select, Tap All That Apply, Tap in Sequence, Tap Yes / No, Reveal on Tap
**Drag-Based:** Drag and Drop, Drag to Sort, Drag to Complete, Drag to reorder items
**Matching & Memory:** Match one item to another, Flip to find a pair, Choose the Odd One Out, Match item to placeholder
**Tracing & Movement:** Slide to adjust size or value
**Audio-Led:** Listen and Respond, Listen and respond

### Removed from Grade 1
- Tap to Count (counting should be mental by Grade 2; use Tap to Select instead)
- Tap to Build (too simple for Grade 2 concepts)
- Follow the Path (too simple)
- Trace with Finger (letter/number tracing no longer primary skill)
- Swipe to Move (novelty, less pedagogical value)

### Added
- None new. The set narrows as interactions become more purposeful.

### Preferred for Grade 2
- Drag to Sort (sorting by multiple attributes)
- Choose the Odd One Out (developing analytical thinking)
- Drag to reorder items (sequencing and ordering)
- Match one item to another (concept pairs)

---

## Grade 3 — 15 Types Allowed

### Allowed Types
**Tap-Based:** Tap to Select, Tap All That Apply, Tap in Sequence, Tap Yes / No
**Drag-Based:** Drag and Drop, Drag to Sort, Drag to Complete, Drag to reorder items
**Matching & Memory:** Match one item to another, Choose the Odd One Out, Match item to placeholder
**Audio-Led:** Listen and Respond

### Removed from Grade 2
- Reveal on Tap (too simple; children should actively classify, not just reveal)
- Flip to find a pair (memory games less aligned with analytical goals)
- Slide to adjust size or value (rarely needed beyond measurement topics)
- Listen and respond (duplicate of Listen and Respond)

### Preferred for Grade 3
- Drag to Sort (multi-category classification — trees/shrubs/herbs, food groups, etc.)

### Removed from Grade 3
- None removed. Grade 4 uses the same set as Grade 3 but with more complex content.

### Preferred for Grade 4
- Drag to Sort (multi-attribute sorting — classify by 2+ features)
- Tap All That Apply (select all + justify — "Which of these are renewable resources?")
- Drag to reorder items (process ordering — water cycle steps, historical events)
- Match one item to another (cause → effect, term → definition)
- Tap Yes / No (with reasoning — "Is this statement correct? Why?")

---

## Grade 5 — 13 Types Allowed

### Allowed Types
**Tap-Based:** Tap to Select, Tap All That Apply, Tap in Sequence, Tap Yes / No
**Drag-Based:** Drag and Drop, Drag to Sort, Drag to Complete, Drag to reorder items
**Matching & Memory:** Match one item to another, Choose the Odd One Out, Match item to placeholder
**Audio-Led:** Listen and Respond

### Same as Grade 4
Grade 5 uses the same interaction set. The cognitive complexity comes from the content, not the interaction mechanism.

### Preferred for Grade 5
- Tap All That Apply (multi-select with evaluation — "Select all factors that cause pollution")
- Drag to Sort (complex classification — sort by multiple criteria)
- Drag to reorder items (process ordering, prioritisation tasks)
- Tap Yes / No (evaluate statements — "Ravi says forests are not important. Do you agree?")
- Match one item to another (complex pairing — match arguments to evidence)
