## Grade 3 — EVS

### Types of Plants (Trees, Shrubs, Herbs)

**Key Definitions:**
- Tree: A tall plant with one thick, strong trunk made of wood. Its branches grow high above the ground. Trees give shade and take many years to grow.
- Shrub: A medium-sized plant with many woody stems growing close to the ground. Shrubs are shorter than trees and bushier.
- Herb: A small plant with soft, green stems that do not become woody. Herbs are the smallest type of plant.
- Climber: A plant with a long, thin stem that cannot stand on its own. It grows upward by climbing on other plants or walls for support.
- Creeper: A plant with a thin stem that grows along the ground. It spreads sideways because it has no support to climb.
- Trunk: The thick, strong, main stem of a tree made of wood.
- Woody Stem: A stem that is hard, brown, and made of wood. Trees and shrubs have woody stems.
- Soft Stem: A stem that is green, flexible, and not made of wood. Herbs have soft stems.

**Required Examples:**
- Trees: Mango, Neem, Jamun, Banyan, Peepal, Coconut
- Shrubs: Rose, Tulsi, Hibiscus, Mehendi, Lemon
- Herbs: Mint, Tomato, Coriander, Spinach, Wheat, Rice
- Climbers: Money plant, Grapevine, Pea plant, Bean plant
- Creepers: Pumpkin, Watermelon, Strawberry, Sweet potato

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "All small plants are herbs." (Some small plants are young trees or small shrubs. We must check the stem, not just the size.)
- "Grass is not a plant." (Grass is a type of herb with soft stems.)
- "Climbers and creepers are the same." (Climbers go up by attaching to a support. Creepers spread along the ground.)
- "Tulsi is a herb because it is small." (Tulsi has woody stems, so it is a shrub.)

### Parts of a Plant

**Key Definitions:**
- Root: The part of the plant that grows underground. Roots hold the plant in the soil and absorb water and nutrients.
- Stem: The part that grows above the ground and holds up the leaves, flowers, and fruits. It carries water from roots to leaves.
- Leaf: The flat, green part of a plant that makes food using sunlight, air, and water. This process is called photosynthesis.
- Flower: The colourful part of a plant that helps it make seeds.
- Fruit: The part that grows from the flower and holds the seeds inside.
- Seed: The part that can grow into a new plant.

**Required Examples:**
- Roots we eat: Carrot, radish, beetroot, turnip
- Stems we eat: Sugarcane, potato (underground stem), ginger
- Leaves we eat: Spinach, cabbage, lettuce, mint
- Flowers we eat: Cauliflower, broccoli, banana flower
- Fruits we eat: Mango, apple, tomato, cucumber
- Seeds we eat: Rice, wheat, mustard, peas

## Grade 3 — Maths

### Numbers and Place Value

**Key Definitions:**
- Place Value: The value of a digit based on its position in a number. In 352: 3 is in the hundreds place (value 300), 5 is in the tens place (value 50), 2 is in the ones place (value 2).
- Expanded Form: Writing a number to show the value of each digit. Example: 352 = 300 + 50 + 2.
- Comparison: Using greater than (>), less than (<), and equal to (=) to compare numbers. Example: 425 > 389 because 4 hundreds is more than 3 hundreds.

---

### Addition

**Key Definitions:**
- Carrying (Regrouping): When the sum of digits in a column is 10 or more, we write the ones digit below and carry the tens digit to the next column.
- Sum: The answer of an addition problem.
- Word Problem: A math question written as a story. We read the story, find the numbers, and decide whether to add or subtract.

---

### Subtraction

**Key Definitions:**
- Borrowing (Regrouping): When the top digit is smaller than the bottom digit, we borrow 1 from the next column to make it bigger.
- Difference: The answer of a subtraction problem.

## Grade 4 — EVS

### Family, Community, and Relationships

**Key Definitions:**
- Nuclear Family: A family with parents and their children living together.
- Joint Family: A family where grandparents, parents, children, uncles, aunts, and cousins all live together.
- Extended Family: Family members who do not live with us but are related to us, such as grandparents in another city, cousins, and relatives.
- Community: A group of people living in the same area who share spaces, services, and sometimes traditions.
- Cooperation: Working together with others to get something done. Everyone helps in their own way.
- Neighbourhood: The area around our home where our neighbours live.

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Only nuclear families are real families." (Joint and extended families are equally real and valued.)
- "Community means only neighbours." (Community includes schools, markets, hospitals, and all the people and places in our area.)

### Plants Around Us (Grade 4 — Expanded)

**Key Definitions:**
- Photosynthesis: The process by which green plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is released as a result.
- Germination: The process by which a seed starts to grow into a new plant. It needs water, air, and warmth.
- Deforestation: Cutting down large areas of forest. This harms animals, reduces oxygen, and causes soil erosion.
- Conservation: Protecting and saving natural resources like forests, water, and wildlife for the future.

**Required Examples:**
- Photosynthesis: Leaves are green because they have a substance called chlorophyll that captures sunlight.
- Germination: Soak a bean seed in wet cotton for 3 days to see it sprout.
- Deforestation: Forests in India are being cut for roads and buildings.
- Conservation: Planting trees, not wasting paper, using recycled products.

---

### Water — Source of Life

**Key Definitions:**
- Water Cycle: The continuous movement of water — from rivers and oceans to the sky (evaporation), forming clouds (condensation), and falling back as rain (precipitation).
- Evaporation: Water turning into water vapour (gas) when heated by the sun.
- Condensation: Water vapour cooling down and turning into tiny water droplets that form clouds.
- Precipitation: Water falling from clouds as rain, snow, or hail.
- Conservation of Water: Saving water by not wasting it. Examples: turning off taps, fixing leaks, collecting rainwater.

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Clouds are made of cotton or smoke." (Clouds are made of tiny water droplets.)
- "Rain comes from the sea directly." (Rain comes from clouds formed by evaporation from all water bodies.)

## Grade 5 — EVS

### The Earth and Its Resources

**Key Definitions:**
- Natural Resources: Materials found in nature that humans use. Examples: water, soil, air, minerals, forests, and fossil fuels.
- Renewable Resources: Resources that can be replaced naturally over time. Examples: sunlight, wind, water, forests (if managed well).
- Non-Renewable Resources: Resources that cannot be replaced once used up. Examples: coal, petroleum, natural gas.
- Fossil Fuels: Fuels formed from the remains of ancient plants and animals over millions of years. Examples: coal, petroleum, natural gas.
- Soil Erosion: The washing or blowing away of the top layer of soil by water or wind. This makes the land less fertile.

**Required Examples:**
- Renewable: Solar energy, wind energy, river water, trees
- Non-renewable: Coal (used in power plants), petroleum (used for fuel), natural gas (used for cooking)
- Soil types: Sandy (loose, drains fast), Clay (sticky, holds water), Loamy (mix, best for farming)

**Common Misconceptions:**
- "Water is unlimited." (Only 3% of Earth's water is fresh water, and most of it is in glaciers.)
- "Fossil fuels will last forever." (They take millions of years to form and are running out.)
- "All natural resources are renewable." (Coal, petroleum, and minerals are non-renewable.)
