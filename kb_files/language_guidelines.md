# Grade-Level Language Guidelines — Knowledge Base

**Purpose:** Calibrate vocabulary, sentence complexity, question types, and instruction language per grade.
**Authority:** This file is the final authority on language complexity. If a generated lesson exceeds the limits for its target grade, it must be rewritten.

---

## How to Use This File

1. Identify the target grade from the user input.
2. Apply ALL constraints from that grade's section to every part of the lesson.
3. The model must not exceed the grade ceiling for any constraint.
4. When in doubt, simplify. It is always safer to be one level simpler than one level harder.

## Grade K (Kindergarten, Age 4–5)

### Sentence Rules
- Maximum sentence length: 5–7 words
- Only simple declarative sentences (Subject + Verb + Object)
- No compound sentences (no "and," "but," "or" joining clauses)
- No subordinate clauses (no "because," "when," "if," "although")
- One idea per sentence, no exceptions

### Vocabulary Rules
- Only concrete, visible, touchable nouns (ball, cat, tree, hand)
- No abstract nouns (friendship, idea, difference, type)
- Basic action verbs only (run, eat, sit, look, tap, drag, clap)
- Primary colours only (red, blue, green, yellow)
- Basic size words only (big, small, tall, short)
- New words per lesson: 2–3 maximum
- Every new word must be shown with a picture and spoken aloud

### Question Types Allowed
- Yes / No only ("Is this a cat?")
- "What is this?" (single-word answer expected)
- "How many?" (number answer expected)
- "Which one?" with visual choices (tap to select)

### Instruction Language
- Use: "Tap," "Drag," "Look at," "Listen," "Say it"
- Do not use: "Select," "Choose," "Identify," "Classify," "Compare"
- All instructions must be doable by a child who cannot read — pair every text instruction with audio and a visual cue

### Teacher Speech Style
- Use the child's world: "your toys," "your home," "your school"
- Name objects directly: "This is a ball. It is red."
- No rhetorical questions
- No idioms, metaphors, or figurative language
- Praise: "Good job!" "Well done!" "You did it!"

### Examples of Correct Grade K Language
```

Bad:  "This is a mango tree, which is an example of a tall plant."

Good: "Tap the red ball."
Bad:  "Select the object that is red in colour."

## Audio Delivery Rules (All Grades)

These rules apply when the lesson is delivered via AI voice narration (e.g., ElevenLabs):

### Pacing Markers
- `[Beat]` — 1-second pause. Use after questions to give the child time to think.
- `[Pause]` — 2-second pause. Use once per section for reflection.
- `[Emphasis: word]` — The AI voice should stress this word. Use for key vocabulary on first introduction.

### Rhythm Rules
- Alternate sentence lengths for natural flow: short (3–5 words), then medium (6–10 words).
- Every concept section must end with a transition sentence to the next section.
- Never place more than 3 sentences of the same length in a row.

### Narration Constraints
- All "Teacher says" and "Teacher explains" lines will be spoken aloud.
- Avoid words that sound similar when spoken (e.g., "tree" and "three" in the same sentence).
- Spell out numbers below 20 as words ("five," not "5") in narration lines.
- Keep question sentences short — long spoken questions are hard to follow.
