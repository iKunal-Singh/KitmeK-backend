## CORE PEDAGOGICAL PRINCIPLES

- Learning is child-centred and constructivist. Children learn best by connecting new ideas to their own experiences.
- Teaching should move from known to unknown, concrete to abstract, and simple to complex.
- Concepts should be introduced through examples, then named clearly, then reinforced.
- Teachers act as guides, not storytellers or performers.

## BLOOM'S TAXONOMY FRAMEWORK

All lessons must align to Bloom's Revised Taxonomy. Each section of the lesson targets specific cognitive levels.

### The Six Levels
```
L1: Remember    — Recall facts, terms, definitions
L2: Understand  — Explain ideas, classify, give examples
L3: Apply       — Use a concept in a new situation
L4: Analyze     — Compare, contrast, differentiate, find relationships
L5: Evaluate    — Justify a choice, judge correctness, defend a position
L6: Create      — Produce new or original work (Grades 4–5 only, reflection prompts only)
```

### Bloom's Ceiling by Grade
```
Grade K:   Primarily L1–L2. Maximum L3 in activities only.
Grade 1:   Primarily L1–L2. L3 in activities and quiz.
Grade 2:   L1–L3 freely. L4 in 1–2 questions maximum.
Grade 3:   L1–L4 freely. L5 in 1–2 questions maximum.
Grade 4:   L1–L5 freely. Light L6 in reflection prompts only.
Grade 5:   L1–L5 freely. L6 in reflection and conclusion prompts.
```

### Bloom's × Lesson Section Mapping
```
Opening Narration       — Not assessed (activates prior knowledge)
Narrated Explanation    — L1 (Remember) + L2 (Understand)
Teacher Ask (in-lesson) — L2 (Understand) + L3 (Apply)
Interactive Activity    — L3 (Apply) or L4 (Analyze)
Doubts & Discussion     — L2 + L4 + L5 (one item each)
Quick Quiz              — L1 through L4/L5 (progressive difficulty)
Conclusion Reflection   — L5 (Evaluate)
```

### Bloom's Distribution Across Quick Quiz (10 questions)
```
Questions 1–3: L1–L2 (Remember, Understand) — warm-up
Questions 4–7: L2–L3 (Understand, Apply) — core practice
Questions 8–10: L3–L5 (Apply, Analyze, Evaluate) — stretch
```

Exact distribution per grade:

| Grade | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | L5 | Total |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----| ------|
| K     | 4  | 4  | 2  | 0  | 0  | 10    |
| 1     | 3  | 4  | 2  | 1  | 0  | 10    |
| 2     | 3  | 3  | 2  | 1  | 1  | 10    |
| 3     | 2  | 3  | 3  | 1  | 1  | 10    |
| 4     | 2  | 2  | 3  | 2  | 1  | 10    |
| 5     | 1  | 2  | 3  | 2  | 2  | 10    |

## LEARNING PROGRESSION (Bloom's-Mapped)

Every lesson must follow this progression:

| Step | Name | Bloom's Level | What Happens |
|------|------|---------------|-------------|
| 1 | Understand | L2 | Child grasps the concept through explanation |
| 2 | See | L1 | Child observes examples (visual + audio) |
| 3 | Do | L3 | Child practices with an interactive activity |
| 4 | Think | L4 | Child compares, differentiates, connects |
| 5 | Check | L1–L4 | Quiz assesses across levels |
| 6 | Reflect | L5 | Child evaluates, judges, or connects to life |

---

## LANGUAGE & TONE GUIDELINES

- Use short, clear, declarative sentences.
- One idea per sentence.
- Vocabulary must be age-appropriate and explicit.
- When a new term appears, define it immediately and give a simple example.
- Avoid unnecessary storytelling unless it directly supports understanding.
- Tone should be warm, encouraging, and instructional.
- NOT a game-show host or cartoon character.
- Use curiosity prompts: "Have you ever noticed...?" "Can you guess?"
- Acknowledge the child: "Good." "That is right." "Think about this."
- No filler or chattiness. Every sentence should teach or engage.

**For detailed per-grade language rules, refer to `language_guidelines.md`.**

---

## OPENING NARRATION STRUCTURE

Every lesson must open with exactly 4 lines following this structure:

| Line | Name | Purpose | Format |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | Greeting | Signal class is starting | "Good morning, children." |
| 2 | Connect | Link topic to child's life; activate prior knowledge | Question or observation ending with [Beat] |
| 3 | Preview | State what the lesson covers | "Today we will learn..." |
| 4 | Invite | Signal lesson is starting; give child agency | "Let us begin..." |

Rules:
- Line 1 must be a simple greeting. Keep it consistent across lessons.
- Line 2 must end with `[Beat]` to give the child time to think.
- One of Lines 2–3 must include `[Pause]` (2-second reflection pause).
- Line 4 must use "we" or "us" language.
- If the input context includes a story or characters, Line 2 should reference them.

---

## CONCEPT TEACHING STYLE

When explaining any concept:
1. Begin with a simple, familiar situation the child already knows.
2. Introduce the concept name explicitly (e.g., "These are called shrubs.").
3. Provide one clear example with a visual.
4. State one key attribute that distinguishes this concept from others.
5. Reinforce with a value such as care, respect, or environmental awareness.

Between concept subsections, include exactly one transition sentence:
- "Now let us look at a different kind of plant."
- "Good. Next, we will learn about herbs."

---

## AUDIO DELIVERY RULES

All lessons are delivered via AI voice narration. Follow these rules:

### Pacing Markers
- `[Beat]` — 1-second pause after questions (let the child think)
- `[Pause]` — 2-second pause for reflection (once per section)
- `[Emphasis: word]` — Key vocabulary the voice should stress

### Rhythm
- Alternate short sentences (3–5 words) with medium sentences (6–10 words)
- Never place 3+ sentences of the same length in a row
- Every concept section must end with a transition sentence

### Audio-Safe Language
- Avoid words that sound alike in the same sentence ("tree" and "three")
- Spell out numbers below 20 as words in narration lines
- Keep spoken questions short — long questions are hard to follow aurally

---

## STRUCTURED VISUAL DIRECTIONS

Every narration block must be followed by an On Screen block using this structure:

```
On Screen:
Layout: [brief layout type — e.g., "single image center," "left-right comparison," "three items in a row"]
Static elements: [what is shown but not interactive]
Interactive elements: [what the child can tap/drag, if any]
Labels: [any text labels on screen]
Animation: [any motion, highlighting, or transitions]
```

---

## ACTIVITIES — DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

- Activities should help children understand, not just recall.
- Prefer visual, classification, matching, or sorting activities.
- Activities should relate directly to the concept just taught.
- Keep activities simple and confidence-building.
- Avoid abstract or trick-based tasks.
- The activity interaction type must come from the allowed list for the target grade (see `digital_interactions.md`).

---

## FEEDBACK RULES

### Correct Feedback
- Affirm warmly first ("Yes!" "Good thinking!" "Well done!")
- Then restate the reasoning, not just the fact
- BAD: "Correct. Mango is a tree."
- GOOD: "Yes! Mango has a thick trunk. That is how we know it is a tree."

### Incorrect Feedback — Multi-Tier Hints
For interactive activities, provide three tiers:

```
Hint 1 (Gentle nudge): Point to the key attribute.
  Example: "Look at the stem. Is it soft or hard?"

Hint 2 (More explicit): State the rule and ask the child to apply it.
  Example: "Plants with soft green stems are called herbs. Does this plant have a soft green stem?"

Hint 3 (Reveal with reasoning): Give the answer and explain why.
  Example: "Mint has a soft green stem. So it is a herb, not a tree."
```

For quiz questions, provide one feedback line that:
- If correct: affirms + restates reasoning
- If incorrect: gives the correct answer + explains the key attribute

---

## ASSESSMENT PHILOSOPHY

- Assessment should be formative, short, and supportive.
- Questions should check understanding, not memorization.
- Feedback should build confidence and clarity.
- Avoid long tests or multi-step evaluation for a single lesson.
- Tag every question with its Bloom's level.
- Quiz difficulty must progress from L1 → L5 across the 10 questions.

---

## INCLUSION & VALUES

- Use inclusive, non-stereotypical language.
- Represent diverse families, cultures, and abilities respectfully.
- Use Indian names from diverse regions (not only Hindi-speaking names).
- Reinforce values such as:
  - Respect
  - Cooperation
  - Kindness
  - Responsibility
  - Care for others and the environment

---

## STORY CONTEXT INTEGRATION

- If the input context includes a story, characters, or narrative (e.g., Gopu, Simmi, Raj from the textbook), the lesson MUST reference them.
- Weave the story frame into the Opening Narration (Line 2 — Connect) and at least one concept explanation.
- Do NOT copy the story verbatim. Reference the characters and setting briefly to maintain continuity with the textbook.
- If no story is provided, do not invent fictional characters.

---

## ACCESSIBILITY GUIDANCE

- Prefer clarity over decoration.
- Do not rely on colour alone to convey meaning.
- All content must be understandable through audio narration alone.
- Visual directions must be complete enough for a developer to build the screen without guessing.

---

## CONSTRAINTS — THINGS TO NEVER DO

- No emojis
- No role-play or acting directions
- No stage directions ("*waves hand*")
- No filler words or phrases
- No game-show host energy
- No metaphors unless essential and immediately explained
- No content that exceeds the grade's language ceiling
- No new concepts introduced after the Narrated Explanation section
- No interaction types not listed in the digital_interactions.md for the target grade
